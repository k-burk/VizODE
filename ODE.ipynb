# Code created by Kara Burkholder on 9.15.21.
# Packages used matplotlib, scipy, and numpy.
# Code was immplemented by creating amdahl's law as a function
# and then using odeint to integrate the function as n(the #
# of processors) goes to infinity.

def amdahl(x, f, n):
    dxdf = 1 / ((1 - f) + (f / n))
    # n = # of processors, f = parallel proportion of algoritm
    return dxdf


#initial condition is 1 because there is no speedup
x0 = 1

# number of processors starting at 1 and ending at 1024
n = np.linspace(1, 1024)

# solving ODEs for different f values

#plotting results

#adding labels to plot
